# WIP Page Integration - Usage Guide

## Overview

I've successfully integrated the WIP (Work In Progress) page component into your React Router v7 + TypeScript + Vite stack. The component is now fully compatible with your current architecture.

## What Was Created

### 1. Core Component

- **`app/components/WIPPage.tsx`** - The main reusable WIP page component
  - Properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
  - Uses React Router's `useNavigate` hook instead of window navigation
  - Integrates with your existing Navbar and Footer components
  - Supports customizable title, description, and progress

### 2. Route Components

I've created several example WIP route components:

- **`app/routes/about.tsx`** - About Us page (25% progress)
- **`app/routes/contact.tsx`** - Contact Us page (10% progress)
- **`app/routes/services.tsx`** - Services page (30% progress)
- **`app/routes/research.tsx`** - Research & Analysis page (40% progress)
- **`app/routes/wip.tsx`** - Generic WIP route with URL parameters

### 3. Updated Routes Configuration

- **`app/routes.ts`** - Added all new routes to the configuration

## Usage Examples

### Using a Specific WIP Route

```typescript
// Navigate to a specific WIP page
navigate("/about");
navigate("/contact");
navigate("/services");
navigate("/research");
```

### Using the Generic WIP Route

```typescript
// Navigate with custom parameters
navigate(
  "/wip?title=Custom Page&description=This is a custom description&progress=50"
);
```

### Using WIPPage Component Directly

```typescript
import { WIPPage } from '../components/WIPPage';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <WIPPage
      title="My Custom Page"
      description="This page is being developed with special features."
      progress={75}
    />
  );
}
```

## Required Files

All necessary files are already present in your project:

- ✅ `app/components/Navbar.tsx` - Already exists
- ✅ `app/components/Footer.tsx` - Already exists
- ✅ `app/utils/cms.ts` - Already exists
- ✅ `lucide-react` package - Already installed
- ✅ `react-router` - Already installed

## Available Routes

Your application now supports these routes:

- `/` - Home page
- `/about` - About Us (WIP)
- `/contact` - Contact Us (WIP)
- `/services` - Services (WIP)
- `/research` - Research & Analysis (WIP)
- `/news` - News page
- `/newsroom` - Newsroom page
- `/newsletter/:id` - Newsletter detail page
- `/wip` - Generic WIP page with URL parameters

## Testing

The dev server is running at `http://localhost:5173/`. You can test any of the WIP pages by navigating to their respective URLs.

## Customization

Each WIP page can be customized by:

1. Modifying the `title`, `description`, and `progress` props
2. Updating the meta tags for SEO
3. Adjusting the progress percentage to reflect actual development status

## Next Steps

When you're ready to implement actual content for any page:

1. Replace the WIPPage component with your actual page content
2. Keep the same route structure and meta configuration
3. Update the progress to 100% or remove the WIP entirely
